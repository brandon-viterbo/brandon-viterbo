# About Me
I've really been enjoying fixing the problems I have with teaching myself guitar using JavaScript, Python, and Kotlin. The clarity of the latter makes me wish
I learned it alongside Java in my academic career. Currently looking for a role in web development where I can expand the impact of my code beyond the confines of
my musical education. If you're hiring, feel free to reach out!

## Addendum
- Currently reading *Structure and Intrepretation of Computer Programs* by Harold Abelson, and Gerald and Julie Sussman, and *The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy* by
Laurence Sterne.
- Currently listening through the discographies of John Coltrane, Anthony Braxton, and Mogwai.
- Pourover is my go to coffee brewing method.
- Getting a cat is my second priority right now, just behind (just!) getting a job.
